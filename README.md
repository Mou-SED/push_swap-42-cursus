# push_swap-42-cursus
This project asks you to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, in as few moves as possible. To succeed, you will have to manipulate different sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for an optimized sorting of the data.

## What is a Stack?
A stack is a linear data structure in which insertions and deletions are allowed only at the end, called the top of the stack.

## Why Linked List?
Use Linked List when the size of the stack is not known in advance.
